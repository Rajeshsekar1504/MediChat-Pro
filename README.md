# 🩺 MediChat Pro

**MediChat Pro** is an intelligent **medical document assistant** built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).  
It allows users to upload their **medical documents (PDF)** and interact with them through a chat interface.  

The application uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to retrieve relevant information from uploaded documents and generate accurate, context-aware answers.
